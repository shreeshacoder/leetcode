/* Question: You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number 
and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original 
matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were. If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output 
the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

//Solution

class Solution {
    public int[][] matrixReshape(int[][] nums, int r, int c) {
        int i, j, x = 0, y = 0;
        int columns = nums[0].length, rows = nums.length;
        int result[][] = new int[r][c];
        if((rows*columns) != (r*c))
            return nums;
        for(i = 0; i<r; i++){
            for(j = 0;j<c;j++, y++) {
                y = y%columns;
                result[i][j] = nums[x][y];
                if(y == columns-1)
                    x++;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
