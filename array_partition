/* Question: Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, 
say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

//Solution

class Solution {
    public int arrayPairSum(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int i = 0, result = 0;
        while((i+1)<nums.length) {
            result += Math.min(nums[i], nums[i+1]);
            i+=2;
        }
    return result;
