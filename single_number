Question: Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Note: I looked at the solution, but to be fair, someone who knows that XOR is associative would think of using it.

//Solution


class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int res = nums[0];
       for(int i = 1; i<nums.length; i++) {
           res = res^nums[i];
       }
       return res;
    }
}
